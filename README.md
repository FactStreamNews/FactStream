In today's digital age, the proliferation of online news has led to increased partisanship and a surge in "clickbait" articles that prioritize revenue over factual accuracy. This trend poses a significant challenge for individuals seeking reliable and balanced information. The dominance of sensationalist content often obscures critical issues and fosters polarization among readers. Our news aggregator, FactStream, aims to address these concerns by providing a curated platform that emphasizes diverse perspectives and high-quality journalism. By filtering out low-quality articles and highlighting news from reputable sources, we strive to offer a more holistic and less biased view of current events, making it easier for users to access trustworthy information and form well-rounded opinions. Also, while filtering out low-quality articles, we also seek to tailor the news experience to the individual, allowing them to get the most out of their time.

FactStream addresses the contemporary challenge of accessing unbiased and accurate news in a digital landscape dominated by sensationalism and biased reporting. Designed for a broad audience, from casual readers to those deeply engaged with daily events, our platform sets itself apart from existing aggregators like ZeroHedge and Drudge Report by prioritizing factual accuracy over engagement. Unlike these platforms, which often favor sensationalist content to drive traffic, FactStream strictly curates news through rigorous manual moderation, community reporting, and potential machine learning integration to minimize bias and misinformation. Enhanced by interactive features such as comments, likes, article favoriting, and sophisticated filtering options—by category, date, and a unique article quality score—FactStream offers a more immersive and responsible news consumption experience, ensuring that users receive the most reliable information available.
